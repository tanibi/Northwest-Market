# Northwest-Market
->It is an E-commerce app for buying and selling second-hand products online within Northwest Missouri State University.

->Till now we did validations for the create account and login page.

->We have a splash screen implemented.

->To login the email should be in S******@nwmissouri.edu format and password should be atleast 6 characters.

->Logout button will return to login page.

->Every button will direct to the respective page.

->If you click on the image buttons, which are catagories, it will direct user to the details page but as we did not implement the data base you cannot see anything in that page at the moment.  

->Forgot page is not totally implemented as we need database to implement that page.

We are using Firebase Database to store users data.
